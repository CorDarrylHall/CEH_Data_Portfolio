## About Me

My extensive experience includes serving as a Business/Data Intelligence Analyst, where I successfully lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects from start to finish --- working with stakeholders to plan requirements, manage project schedules, identify risks, and communicate clearly with cross-functional partners across the company. I have effectively managed the execution of strategic engineering objectives using tools such as Smartsheet and Lucid Planner, resulting in significant achievements like increasing Intel NUC device production from \$4 million to \$6 million over 10 years and orchestrating collaboration among 13 cross-functional teams to achieve a 33% revenue increase over three quarters.

In my roles, I have showcased my proficiency in managing intricate compensation data processes and reporting at both Lam Research and Intel Corporation. I utilized tools like Power BI and Tableau and developed dashboards using languages such as R, Python, and SQL. As a Business Analyst/Program Manager at Intel, I led a team to achieve record-breaking milestones in product introductions. My background also includes serving in the United States Navy, where I managed extensive equipment inventories and led multiple deployments. Additionally, I hold an MBA from Willamette University, where I consulted for the Boys & Girls Club, saving them over \$500K.

I am enthusiastic about discussing how I can contribute to your company's success and look forward to potential collaborations.
